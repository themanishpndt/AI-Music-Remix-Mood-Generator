## 🎚️ AI-Powered Audio Remixing

### Core Features

#### 1. **🤖 Intelligent Mood Transformation**
Transform your audio from one mood to another using AI algorithms.

**How it works:**
- Analyzes source mood characteristics
- Calculates target mood parameters
- Applies intelligent transformations:
  - Energy adjustment (volume & dynamics)
  - Brightness filtering (frequency content)
  - Automatic tempo adaptation

**Example:**
- Transform a sad song → energetic version
- Make a calm track → dark and moody
- Convert happy music → uplifting anthem

**To use:**
1. Enable "AI Mood Transform" toggle
2. Select source mood (current mood of your audio)
3. Select target mood (desired mood)
4. Click "Remix Audio"

---

#### 2. **🎹 Pitch Shifting**
Change the pitch of your audio without affecting tempo.

**Range:** -12 to +12 semitones
- **Negative values**: Lower pitch (deeper, darker)
- **Positive values**: Higher pitch (brighter, lighter)

**Creative uses:**
- Make vocals sound deeper or higher
- Change the key of a song
- Create chipmunk or deep voice effects
- Match different songs' keys

**Examples:**
- `-2 semitones`: Slightly darker, more serious
- `+4 semitones`: Brighter, more uplifting
- `+12 semitones`: One octave higher

---

#### 3. **🎼 Harmony Layers**
Add harmonic layers to create richer, fuller sound.

**Harmony Types:**

**Third (Major Third)**
- Adds notes 4 semitones above
- Creates warm, pleasant harmonies
- Great for vocals and melodies

**Fifth (Perfect Fifth)**
- Adds notes 7 semitones above
- Creates powerful, stable harmonies
- Perfect for rock and epic sounds

**Octave**
- Doubles the melody one octave higher
- Creates fuller, richer sound
- Works with any genre

**To use:**
1. Open "Advanced Creative Controls"
2. Enable "Add Harmony Layer"
3. Select harmony type
4. Remix!

---

#### 4. **⚡ Tempo Control**
Speed up or slow down your audio.

**Range:** 0.5x to 2.0x
- **0.5x**: Half speed (slow, dramatic)
- **1.0x**: Original speed
- **2.0x**: Double speed (fast, energetic)

**Note:** This changes both tempo AND pitch. For pitch-independent tempo change, combine with pitch shift.

**Creative uses:**
- Slow down for dramatic effect
- Speed up for high-energy versions
- Create lo-fi slowed versions
- Make nightcore-style remixes

---

#### 5. **🔍 AI Audio Analysis**
Analyze your audio and get AI-powered suggestions.

**What it analyzes:**
- **Energy**: How dynamic and powerful the audio is
- **Brightness**: Frequency content (bright vs dark)
- **Dynamic Range**: Volume variation

**What you get:**
- Suggested moods based on audio characteristics
- Suggested genres that match the style
- Creative transformation ideas
- Audio duration and features

**To use:**
1. Upload your audio file
2. Click "Analyze Audio & Get AI Suggestions"
3. Review the analysis
4. Apply suggested transformations

---

#### 6. **🎨 Genre-Specific Effects**

Each genre applies unique effects:

**Electronic** 🎹
- Square waveforms
- Reverb + Filters
- Rhythmic patterns

**Ambient** 🌊
- Sine waveforms
- Heavy reverb + Delay
- Spacious, atmospheric

**Rock** 🎸

## 🧠 Understanding the AI

### How Mood Transformation Works

The AI analyzes differences between moods:

**Energy Transformation**
- Calculates energy difference
- Adjusts volume and dynamics
- Applies compression/expansion

**Brightness Transformation**
- Compares frequency characteristics
- Applies appropriate filters:
  - High-pass for brighter
  - Low-pass for darker

**Tempo Adaptation**
- Calculates tempo ratio
- Adjusts playback speed
- Maintains musical coherence

### Audio Analysis Algorithm

1. **Feature Extraction**
   - RMS Energy (loudness)
   - Zero-Crossing Rate (brightness)
   - Dynamic Range (variation)

2. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identifies energy patterns
   - Detects rhythmic elements
   - Analyzes frequency content

3. **Intelligent Suggestions**
   - Matches features to moods
   - Suggests compatible genres
   - Recommends transformations
